##Hey There, Thanks for stopping by 

I'm Shelby Russ (If you haven't discerned that by now) and this is my own little corner of the internet, where I can show off the work that I've done, and talk about the things that are important to me. I've been programming since the early 2000s, though I've only seriously pursued the craft for about 5 years. I was born in the fall of 1991, a glorious time for video games and technology. I've always loved tinkering with computers in some form (I was playing the SNES when I was only 3!). When I was introduced to my first personal computer, I was blown away by the sheer amount of things that you could do with it. I was hooked, but it wasn't until much later that I became curious about what was 'under the hood' so to speak. 

I've developed on small teams, as an independent freelancer, and on several passion project, namely, the maps app [Project Tripstr](https://arcane-basin-98906.herokuapp.com/#_=_) Which allows you to set your destination, and then pick out fun stops to make along the way, sort of like planning a road trip, on your phone! I'm super excited about having a working prototype of that app available. 

Well, thanks for stopping by, there isn't much more to say, I love programming and making things in general (I'm also an apprentice blacksmith, I love smashing hot steel). if you'd like to work with me, be sure to reach out on Twitter, and be sure to check out my github, to stay up to date with what I'm working on currently!
